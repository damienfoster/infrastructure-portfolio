Architected a containerized network management layer by deploying a UniFi SDN controller via Docker on an Ubuntu-based HP Mini-PC. Implemented strict 802.1Q VLAN tagging across dual access points to enforce logical segmentation between IoT, Guest, and Internal traffic, mirroring enterprise-grade security architecture in a compact edge environment.
